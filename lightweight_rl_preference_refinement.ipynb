    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Management**:\n",
    "   - Use gradient checkpointing: `model.gradient_checkpointing_enable()`\n",
    "   - Reduce batch size if encountering OOM errors\n",
    "   - Use `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between training steps\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Better Rewards**:\n",
    "   - Train reward models on diverse, high-quality human preference data\n",
    "   - Combine multiple reward signals (safety, helpfulness, style)\n",
    "   - Use ensemble reward models for more robust scoring\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Stability**:\n",
    "   - Monitor KL divergence to prevent policy collapse\n",
    "   - Use smaller learning rates for stable convergence\n",
    "   - Implement early stopping based on reward plateauing\n",

    "| Issue | Solution |\n",
    "|-------|----------|\n",
    "| CUDA OOM | Reduce batch_size, use gradient accumulation |\n",
    "| Poor reward scores | Improve reward model or adjust reward weights |\n",
    "| Training instability | Lower learning rate, increase target KL |\n",
    "| Slow generation | Use smaller models, optimize generation parameters |\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to apply lightweight RL-based preference refinement to PEFT-tuned language models. The key insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Efficiency**: Only training adapter parameters reduces computational cost significantly  \n",
    "✅ **Flexibility**: Reward models can be customized for specific use cases  \n",
    "✅ **Practicality**: The approach works with existing PEFT models  \n",
    "✅ **Scalability**: Can be extended to larger models and datasets  \n",
    "\n",
